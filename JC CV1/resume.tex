	{Online (Indigenous) Health Forum , name of my project has been developed to bridge the gap of languages by allow people using different to exchange ideas using the forum as if they were all writing the same language . This forum has been develop using the Liferay platform. In this project, my aim was to use Liferay framework to dynamically get the words and sentences from one side of the communication and translate it to the corresponding language on the other side. Java was mainly used with the Translator API from Microsoft.}
